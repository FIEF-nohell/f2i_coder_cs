# f2i - file to image converter

This project converts any file into bits, slaps those into an image where white pixels represent 1's and black pixels represent 0's. 

At the end of the bits of the files, there is a red pixel that seperates a couple of bites, those represent the file type.

A decompiler is included as well.
